# Github Pages Website

This is the repository for my static website hosted at https://casvancooten.com.

The website is generated using Hugo and hosted on Github Pages. The 'main' branch contains the source materials (markdown files in the `content` directory) and configuration for Hugo to generate a static website. The static website itself is pushed to the 'gh-pages' branch after generation by the Hugo Github action, which is then published on Github Pages automatically.

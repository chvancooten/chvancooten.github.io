&lt;p>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Cas, an offensive security enthusiast and Red Teamer based in the Netherlands. I like to play around with anything that is related to hacking, security, programming languages, or tech in general. I love to learn, but I love sharing the things that I have learned even more - that&amp;rsquo;s what this blog is for. If you would like to get in touch you can do so via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chvancooten">Twitter&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="mailto:hello@casvancooten.com">email&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m always up for a chat about (offensive) security and the latest new programming languages!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>So You Wanna Hack a Bank? 'Global Central Bank' (PACES) Certification Review</title><link>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2021/10/so-you-wanna-hack-a-bank-global-central-bank-paces-certification-review/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2021/10/so-you-wanna-hack-a-bank-global-central-bank-paces-certification-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Updated &lt;strong>February 13th, 2023&lt;/strong>: The PACES certification has been renamed to &amp;lsquo;Certified Red Team Master&amp;rsquo; (CRTM) and is now licensed by AlteredSecurity instead of PentesterAcademy, this blog post has been updated to reflect.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.alteredsecurity.com/gcb">&amp;ldquo;Global Central Bank&amp;rdquo; (GCB)&lt;/a> labs and accompanying &amp;ldquo;Certified Red Team Master&amp;rdquo; (CRTM) certification are definitely something else. It is more or less the &amp;ldquo;level-up&amp;rdquo; from the respective &lt;a href="https://www.alteredsecurity.com/adlab">&amp;ldquo;Attacking and Defending Active Directory&amp;rdquo; (CRTP)&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.alteredsecurity.com/redteamlab">&amp;ldquo;Windows Red Team Lab&amp;rdquo; (CRTE)&lt;/a> courses, also provided by AlteredSecurity. GCB is the hardest of the three, so if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for more beginner-friendly material, you&amp;rsquo;re probably better off reading &lt;a href="https://casvancooten.com/posts/2020/10/getting-the-crtp-certification-attacking-and-defending-active-directory-course-review/">my blog post on CRTP&lt;/a> instead.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a C2 Implant in Nim - Considerations and Lessons Learned</title><link>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2021/08/building-a-c2-implant-in-nim-considerations-and-lessons-learned/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2021/08/building-a-c2-implant-in-nim-considerations-and-lessons-learned/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="nim-for-offensive-security">Nim for offensive security&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For a while now I have been playing with the programming language &lt;a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim&lt;/a> in the context of Offensive Security. Nim is a relatively young and fairly unknown programming language that has a syntax quite similar to Python&amp;rsquo;s, so is very easy to pick up. It however offers the flexibility and low-level capabilities of languages like C/C++, and has a great foreign function interface. On top of that, it compiles to native C (as well as some other languages), which results in native binaries that are quite slim. This makes it very suitable for malware development, especially for scrubs that are too scared of C/C++ to write any proper program in those languages (like me!).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Operate Like You Mean It: 'Red Team Ops' (CRTO) Course Review</title><link>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2021/07/operate-like-you-mean-it-red-team-ops-crto-course-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2021/07/operate-like-you-mean-it-red-team-ops-crto-course-review/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you hang around the infosec &amp;ldquo;twittersphere&amp;rdquo; or in other security communities, odds are you have already seen someone share their experiences on the &lt;a href="https://www.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/red-team-ops">&amp;lsquo;Red Team Ops&amp;rsquo; course by ZeroPointSecurity&lt;/a>. I had heard a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> about this course prior to enrolling in it myself - almost exclusively consisting of positive reviews. The author of the course, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse">RastaMouse&lt;/a>, is quite a well-known figure in the infosec community. You may know him for his open-source tool contributions, such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Watson">Watson&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://github.com/rasta-mouse/ThreatCheck">ThreatCheck&lt;/a>, or if you are a HackTheBox-enthusiast you may know him for the RastaLabs pro lab.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting the OSEP Certification: 'Evasion Techniques and Breaching Defenses' (PEN-300) Course Review</title><link>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2021/03/getting-the-osep-certification-evasion-techniques-and-breaching-defenses-pen-300-course-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2021/03/getting-the-osep-certification-evasion-techniques-and-breaching-defenses-pen-300-course-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Updated &lt;strong>February 13th, 2023&lt;/strong>: Some referenced courses are now licensed by AlteredSecurity instead of PentesterAcademy, this post has been updated to reflect.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When Offensive Security announced the new &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pen300-osep/#course">PEN-300 course&lt;/a>, also called &amp;ldquo;Evasion Techniques and Breaching Defenses&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/PEN300-Syllabus.pdf">the syllabus&lt;/a> immediately intrigued me. The course promises to provide an advanced course, aimed at &amp;ldquo;OSCP-level penetration testers who want to develop their skills against hardened systems&amp;rdquo;, and discusses more advanced penetration testing topics such as antivirus evasion, process injection and migration, bypassing application whitelisting and network filters, Windows/Linux post-exploitation and lateral movement (hello Active Directory!).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Windows &amp; Active Directory Exploitation Cheat Sheet and Command Reference</title><link>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2020/11/windows-active-directory-exploitation-cheat-sheet-and-command-reference/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2020/11/windows-active-directory-exploitation-cheat-sheet-and-command-reference/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Last update: &lt;strong>November 3rd, 2021&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Updated &lt;strong>November 3rd, 2021&lt;/strong>: Included several fixes and actualized some techniques. Changes made to the Defender evasion, RBCD, Domain Enumeration, Rubeus, and Mimikatz sections. Fixed some whoopsies as well&lt;/em> ðŸ™ƒ.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Updated &lt;strong>June 5th, 2021&lt;/strong>: I have made some more changes to this post based on (among others) techniques discussed in ZeroPointSecurity&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Red Team Ops&amp;rsquo; course (for the CRTO certification). I&amp;rsquo;ve re-written and improved many sections. New sections have been added on DPAPI and GPO abuse. Notable changes have been made to the the sections on LAPS, AppLocker &amp;amp; CLM, PowerView, and Overpass-the-Hash with Rubeus. Enjoy! :)&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting the CRTP Certification: 'Attacking and Defending Active Directory' Course Review</title><link>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2020/10/getting-the-crtp-certification-attacking-and-defending-active-directory-course-review/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2020/10/getting-the-crtp-certification-attacking-and-defending-active-directory-course-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Updated &lt;strong>February 13th, 2023&lt;/strong>: The CRTP certification is now licensed by AlteredSecurity instead of PentesterAcademy, this blog post has been updated to reflect.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a red teamer -or as a hacker in general- you&amp;rsquo;re guaranteed to run into Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Active Directory sooner or later. Almost every major organization uses Active Directory (which we will mostly refer to as &amp;lsquo;AD&amp;rsquo;) to manage authentication and authorization of servers and workstations in their environment. It is a complex product, and managing it securely becomes increasingly difficult at scale.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Try Harder: Yet Another Journey To OSCP</title><link>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2020/05/try-harder-yet-another-journey-to-oscp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2020/05/try-harder-yet-another-journey-to-oscp/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>The first part of this blog post dives into my personal OSCP story.

&lt;h2 id="preamble">Preamble&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t have a very technical background. I did a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Information Science before starting as a Cyber Security Consultant. In my current role, I deal with various cyber topics on an organizational level - usually not from a very technical perspective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Generating pretty PWK reports with Pandoc and Markdown (templates inside!)</title><link>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2020/05/generating-pretty-pwk-reports-with-pandoc-and-markdown-templates-inside/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2020/05/generating-pretty-pwk-reports-with-pandoc-and-markdown-templates-inside/</guid><description>&lt;p>For some people, the reporting bit of the PWK course may be their pride and joy leading up to their OSCP certification. For others, it&amp;rsquo;s just a necessity that they want to get out of the way. Either way, handing in a report describing your findings is a requirement posed by Offensive Security - so you&amp;rsquo;re gonna have to do it if you want to obtain that elusive OSCP certification!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OSCP Cheat Sheet and Command Reference</title><link>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2020/05/oscp-cheat-sheet-and-command-reference/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casvancooten.com/pr-preview/pr-2/posts/2020/05/oscp-cheat-sheet-and-command-reference/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Updated &lt;strong>May 18th, 2020&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since my OSCP certification exam is coming up, I decided to do a writeup of the commands and techniques I have most frequently used in the PWK labs and in similar machines. I aimed for it to be a basic command reference, but in writing it it has grown out to be a bit more than that!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said - it is &lt;em>far from&lt;/em> an exhaustive list. If you feel any important tips, tricks, commands or techniques are missing from this list just get in touch on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chvancooten">Twitter&lt;/a>!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
